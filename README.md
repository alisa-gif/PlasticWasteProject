## Project Overview

Plastic packaging waste has become a growing concern in the European Union, contributing to environmental degradation and the spread of microplastics. This project explores plastic packaging waste generation and recycling performance across EU countries between 2011 and 2022, with the goal of uncovering insights that can support more effective waste management policies.
The analysis investigates which countries generate the most plastic packaging waste, how recycling rates compare across the EU, and whether economic indicators such as GDP per capita correlate with better recycling performance. Trends over time assess whether current efforts are keeping pace with sustainability targets and the EU’s 2030 recycling goals.

## Objectives
1.	Exploratory Analysis: Identify which countries generate the most plastic packaging waste per capita, recycle the most (or least), and how they perform against the EU’s 55% recycling target by 2030.
2.	Economic Context: Explore whether GDP per capita correlates with better recycling performance.
3.	Trends Analysis: Track how plastic waste generation and recycling rates have evolved over time, and what this may indicate about future sustainability outcomes.

## Data Structure
##### Tools used: 
MySQL · Tableau · Excel

##### Source: 
Eurostat.
We used multiple datasets from Eurostat's public database and cleaned them using join functions in mySQL for integration and analysis.
##### Key variables:
-	Plastic packaging waste per capita (2011–2022)
-	Recycling rates of plastic packaging waste (2011–2022)
-	GDP per capita (2011–2022)
-	Population (2015–2022)

## Methodology
To prepare the dataset for analysis and visualization, several data cleaning and preprocessing steps were performed:
- Renamed columns for clarity: since multiple source tables used generic column names like obs_value, these were renamed to meaningful labels such as recycling_rate or population for easier reference and interpretation.
- Merged datasets: four separate tables containing data on recycling rates, plastic waste per capita, population, and GDP per capita were combined into a single table using country names and years as join keys. This allowed for a unified view across all metrics.
- Handled missing values: NULL values were explicitly set to preserve data integrity and allow for accurate handling.
- Filtered and standardized: only EU countries with complete or mostly complete records from 2011–2022 were retained for consistent year-over-year comparison.
These preprocessing steps ensured a cleaner, more coherent dataset and improved the reliability of the final visualizations.

## Executive Summary
Between 2011 and 2022, the average plastic packaging waste per capita in the EU increased by approximately 27%, while average recycling rates stagnated, fluctuating between 37% and 41%. Overall, Germany, France and Italy are accounting for 50% of the total waste generated in the EU in 2022.
There is a significant variation between countries in both waste generation and recycling efforts.
The project highlights the importance of policy, culture, and infrastructure in shaping sustainability outcomes.

## Exploratory Analysis: 
### Waste & Recycling in 2022
- Croatia, Bulgaria and Cyprus have the lowest plastic packaging waste per capita, all under 25kg. 
-	Top 5 per capita waste generators: Ireland, Hungary, Portugal, Spain, and Germany. Ireland’s per capita waste (66kg) far exceeds all other EU countries (19kg-45kg range).
-	Recycling rates for Ireland, Hungary, and Portugal are all below 40%, raising concern.

- When looking at the total plastic packaging waste generated by each country in 2022, the top contributors are Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Poland, with the first 3 accounting for 50% of the total waste generated in the EU in 2022. These high figures are largely driven by their large populations.

- Most of the top waste generating countries have recycling rates above 45%, indicating efforts toward circularity and sustainable waste management. However, France stands out as an exception — with a recycling rate of only 25%, it is the top country in terms of unrecycled plastic packaging waste per capita, highlighting a significant need for improvement in both recycling infrastructure and policy implementation. 
```sql
SELECT 
	geo,
    population,
    recycling_rate,
    ROUND(population * plastic_waste_kg) AS total_waste_kg,
    ROUND(population * plastic_waste_kg * (recycling_rate / 100)) AS recycled_kg,
    ROUND(population * plastic_waste_kg *(1- recycling_rate / 100)) AS unrecycled_kg,
    ROUND(plastic_waste_kg * (1 - recycling_rate / 100), 2) AS unrecycled_kg_per_capita
    FROM plastic_data
    WHERE recycling_rate IS NOT NULL AND TIME_PERIOD = 2022
    ORDER BY unrecycled_kg DESC
    LIMIT 5
;
```

- The following eight countries generate less than 15 kg of unrecycled plastic packaging waste per capita, performing the best in terms of both low waste generation and effective recycling infrastructure. 
```sql
SELECT 
	geo,
    plastic_waste_kg,
    recycling_rate,
    ROUND(plastic_waste_kg * (1 - recycling_rate / 100), 2) AS unrecycled_kg_per_capita
    FROM plastic_data
    WHERE recycling_rate IS NOT NULL AND TIME_PERIOD = 2022
    ORDER BY unrecycled_kg_per_capita ASC
    LIMIT 10
;
```

### Performance vs. EU Recycling Targets Analysis
The EU has set a 55% recycling target for plastic packaging waste by 2030. As of 2022:
-	Countries likely to meet or exceed the target: Italy, Belgium, Slovakia, Spain, Germany, Slovenia.
-	Countries falling behind with recycling rates under 30%: Malta, Denmark, France, Austria, Hungary, Sweden.

## Economic Influence 
While it may be assumed that wealthier countries would have stronger recycling infrastructure, the data shows no clear correlation between GDP per capita and recycling rates.
This suggests that policy enforcement, cultural habits, and waste management systems play a greater role than economic strength alone.

## Trend Analysis

-	From 2011 to 2022, EU’s plastic packaging waste per capita rose by 27% (from 26.1 kg in 2011 to 33.17 kg in 2022), while recycling rates remained flat (37–41%) — peaking in 2019 and declining post-COVID— despite policy attention and circular economy goals.
-	Recycling rates decreased in 2020–2021, likely due to COVID-19 disruptions, then stabilized in 2022.
-	Plastic waste generation increased steadily over the decade, outpacing recycling improvements.

## Findings and recommendations
-	Countries like Ireland and Hungary need more aggressive waste reduction policies, not just recycling improvements. On the other hand, France which is the second biggest plastic packaging waste generator, has a noticeably low recycling rate, which indicates a need for increasing recycling efforts.
-	The EU may benefit from setting maximum waste generation targets and other measures as requiring a higher rate of waste collection, not just recycling goals.
-	Policymakers should examine non-economic drivers (e.g., education, policy enforcement, public participation) to improve recycling effectiveness.

##  Limitations
While this project offers a broad view of plastic packaging waste and recycling trends across EU countries, there are several limitations that affect the depth of the analysis. First, the dataset does not include  information on plastic types, usage by sector, or the share of waste recovered versus recycled, which limits the ability to analyze material-specific or industry-specific trends. Second, the analysis does not account for the timing or impact of national policies such as plastic bans, extended producer responsibility schemes, or deposit systems — factors that likely influence recycling performance but require separate datasets and policy mapping.
